# Email Parser Lab

## Learning Goals

- Validate that strings match specific patterns using regular expressions.
- Search for strings that match specific patterns using regular expressions...

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
interchangeably.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: programming that is oriented around data
(made mobile and changeable in **objects**) rather than functionality. Python
is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

You will write a program that, given a string of email addresses, parses that
string into an array.

Your class, `EmailAddressParser`, should take the string of addresses on
initialization. Instances should respond to a `parse()` instance method that
parses the string into individual email addresses and returns them in an array.

Your class should be able to do this:

```py
email_addresses = "john@doe.com, person@somewhere.org"
parser = EmailAddressParser(email_addresses)

parser.parse()
# => ["john@doe.com", "person@somewhere.org"]
```

**Note:** Your `EmailAddressParser` class should handle a list of email
addresses that are separated by either spaces _or_ comma-separated values
(CSVs):

```py
EmailAddressParser("john@doe.com, person@somewhere.org").parse
# => ["john@doe.com", "person@somewhere.org"]

EmailAddressParser("john@doe.com person@somewhere.org").parse
# => ["john@doe.com", "person@somewhere.org"]
```

Additionally, the `parse()` method should _only return **unique** addresses,_
sorted alphabetically.

Write your solution in `lib/email_address_parser.py`.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.

**Hints:** in order to get this lab passing, you will need to do some research
into the following topics:

- [re - Regular expression operations - Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [Python Regex Split String Using re.split()](https://pynative.com/python-regex-split/)
- Think back to data structures: what could we cast a list to in order to get
  unique values?
